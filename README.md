"# vehicleBookingApis" 



I am done with this vehicle booking apis
1. Technologies: nodejs with express
2. Database: Postgresql

I have used the sequelize ORM => To sync the data tables in database automatically,I used sequelize.sync() in main file(app.js).
Also for the content of the tables i used seeders for that also i have imported the seeders file in  main file(app.js)



NOTE: Firstly you need to uncommented the sequelize.sync() and imported the seeders file to sync database and insert the sample data respectively.

I have used the postman tool for to test the apis also i have created the collection of it,I will be attaching postman collection of the apis over the mail.
